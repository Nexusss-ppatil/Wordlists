So this rookie pentester totally went full script kiddie mode—threw together a bunch of random wordlists from all over the internet (still a work in progress)—and now they're out here like, "Hey, anyone wanna use these elite lists?" 💾📂😂

Got a giant bag of wordlists ready to dig into your target app? Perfect. Load them up with your favorite tool (you know the one), and aim it at the application to sniff out those hidden files and directories like a digital bloodhound.

These wordlists are massive—seriously packed—so do everyone a favor and set your thread limits. We're here to explore, not accidentally DDoS anything. 😎🐢
