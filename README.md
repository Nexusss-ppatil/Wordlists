Yo, so this noob-ass pentester went full script kiddie mode, scraped together a bunch of random wordlists from the depths of the internet, and now flexin’ like, “Ay, anyone wanna leech these l33t lists?” 💾📂💀

Got a giant bag of wordlists just itching to poke around your target app? Perfect. Load them up with your favorite tool (you know the one), and point it at the application to sniff out those sneaky hidden files and directories like a digital bloodhound.

P.S. The wordlists are thicc—seriously chunky—so be a kind hacker and set those thread limits. We’re here to discover, not DDoS. 😎🐢
